Okay, let's add a new, *failing* integration test for the GET /league endpoint.

We'll modify the existing integration test file (go\_integration\_test). This new test will define the expected behavior: receiving a 200 OK status with a JSON array of User structs, sorted by score in descending order. It will fail initially because neither the /league route nor the required GetLeague() method on the store exists yet.

To ensure test isolation (important when adding data for specific tests), we'll also refactor the test slightly so that the server and store are set up *within* each t.Run block, rather than once for the entire function.

**Changes:**

1. Define the GetLeague() method in the PlayerStore interface (within the test file's copy or assumed to be updated in the actual interface definition).
2. Refactor TestPlayerServerIntegration to perform setup/teardown within each t.Run.
3. Add a new t.Run("Get league table") test case:
    * Sets up a server with a fresh InMemoryPlayerStore.
    * Populates the store with sample player data.
    * Makes a GET request to /league.
    * Asserts the expected 200 OK status, application/json content type, and the correctly sorted JSON array response.

Now, when you run go test, the TestPlayerServerIntegration function will execute, and the new Get league table subtest should fail, likely with a 404 Not Found status, because the /league route hasn't been added to the NewTestPlayerServer setup yet. This follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach: write a failing test first, then implement the code to make it pass.
