```aiprompt
write a golang test for basic 2D shapes: circle, rectangle, triangle, that tests for the perimeter and area. 
Do not include an implementation.

add triangle test cases for colinear and some well known triangle edge lengths, isosceles, right angle etc
you could also expand the tests for Circle and Rectangle - for non int inputs, edge cases etc

add triangle test cases for colinear and some well known triangle edge lengths, isosceles, right angle etc
you could also expand the tests for Circle and Rectangle - for non int inputs, edge cases etc

we need something to check for almost equal values due to rounding errors
